### In Production
The admin panel is automatically hidden in production for security. You can access it by:

## File Structure

Your blog posts are stored as Markdown files in:
```

â””â”€â”€ ...
```

Each file contains:
- **Frontmatter**: Title, date, and excerpt
- **Content**: The main post content in Markdown

## Tips for Writing Great Posts

1. **Use Descriptive Titles**: Make them clear and engaging
2. **Write Good Excerpts**: These appear in post previews and social media
3. **Structure Your Content**: Use headers to organize your thoughts
4. **Preview Before Publishing**: Always check the preview tab
5. **Keep It Consistent**: Use the same formatting style throughout

## Troubleshooting

### If You Can't Access Admin
- Make sure you're in development mode (`npm run dev`)
- Check that you're going to the correct URL (`/admin`)

### If Posts Don't Appear
- Check that the post has a valid date
- Ensure the title and content are not empty
- Look for any error messages in the browser console

### If Markdown Isn't Rendering
- Check your Markdown syntax
- Use the preview tab to see if formatting is correct
- Refer to the Markdown Help section in the editor

## Security Notes

- The admin panel is only accessible in development mode
- In production, the admin routes return 404 errors
- All post data is stored locally in your project files
- No external database is required

## Next Steps

1. **Create Your First Post**: Try writing a simple post to get familiar with the system
2. **Experiment with Markdown**: Use the preview feature to see different formatting options
3. **Organize Your Content**: Use consistent naming and structure for your posts
4. **Regular Publishing**: Set up a schedule for creating new content

Happy blogging! ðŸš€
